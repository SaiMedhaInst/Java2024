Basic Questions
	Sum of Array Elements:
		Write a loop to calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array.
	
	Find Maximum Value:
		Given an array of integers, write a loop to find the maximum value.
	
	Find Minimum Value:
		Given an array of integers, write a loop to find the minimum value.
	
	Count Even Numbers:

	Array of Squares:
		Given an array of integers, create a new array where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original array.
	
	Remove Duplicates:
		Write a loop to remove duplicate values from an array, and store the result in a new array.
	
	Shift Elements:	
		Write a loop to shift all elements of an array to the right by one position. The last element should wrap around to the first position.
	
	Merge Two Arrays:
		Write a loop to merge two arrays into a single array, maintaining the order of elements from the original arrays.

Advanced Questions

	Rotate Array:
		Write a loop to rotate the elements of an array by k positions to the right.
	
	Find Second Largest Element:
		Write a loop to find the second largest element in an array.
	
	Sort Array (Bubble Sort):
	Implement a simple bubble sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
	
	Matrix Transposition:
		Given a 2D matrix, write a loop to transpose it (swap rows with columns).
	
	Array Intersection:
		Given two arrays, write a loop to find the common elements between them.
	
	Two Sum Problem:
		Given an array of integers and a target sum, write a loop to find two distinct elements in the array that add up to the target sum.
	
	Longest Increasing Subsequence:
		Write a loop to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
	
	Frequency Count:
		Write a loop to count the frequency of each element in an array and store the counts in a dictionary or another array.
	
	Kth Largest Element:
		Write a loop to find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.
	
	Partition Array:
		Given an array and a value, partition the array so that all elements less than the given value come before elements greater than or equal to the value.
