					CONDITIONAL OR CONTROL-STATEMENTS IN JAVA 
				#################################################


TYPES OF STATEMENTS:
-------------------------	
1. SEQUENTIAL STATEMENTS
	
    Linear Execution of a program or line by line execution of program.
    The flow of the program will interrupted when there's error or exception.
	
		int a = 10,b=20;
		System.out.print("Addition");
		System.out.println(a+b);
		System.out.println(a-b);
		System.out.println(a/10);
		System.out.println("Ternary")
		System.out.println(a>b?a:b)

2. CONTROL STATEMENTS.
	
    Flow of Execution of the program is decided based on control expression value.
    If TRUE , some block will be executed. 
	If False some other block will be executed.
	
		int age = 26;
		if (age>=18){
			  System.out.println("Eligible to Vote");
		}
		else{
			  System.out.println("Not Eligible to Vote");
		}

3. LOOPING STATEMENTS.
	The Flow of the program is a process of repeative statements or 
	iterations to do particular task.
	

CONTROL STATEMENTS.
--------------------
	
    - Control statements also called as decision making statements
    - Based on the value of control expression the flow of the program will be decided.

	Java has the following conditional statements:

    Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
    Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
    Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
    Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

1. if Statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true.
	
	if (condition) {
		// Code to execute if condition is true
	}
	
2. if else Statement: Provides an alternative block of code that executes 
					 if the condition in the if statement evaluates to false.
	if (condition) {
		// Code to execute if condition is true
	} else {
		// Code to execute if condition is false
	}

3.	else if Statement: Allows for multiple conditions to be tested. 
						It executes the block of code corresponding to the first condition that evaluates to true. 
						If none of the conditions are true, the else block is executed.
						Atmost one true codition block will be execute. 
	if (condition1) {
		// Code to execute if condition1 is true
	} else if (condition2) {
		// Code to execute if condition2 is true
	} else {
		// Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
	}

4. multiple if Statements: 
	if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
	}

	if (condition2) {
		// Code to execute if condition2 is true
	}



SWITCH CASE/STATEMENT
----------------------
	
- Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.
- The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:
- The Java switch expression must be of byte, short, int, long (with its Wrapper type), enums and string.
- The case values must be unique. In case of duplicate value, it renders compile-time error.
- The case value must be of switch expression type only. 
- The case value must be literal or constant. It doesn't allow variables.
- default statement is used as the last statement in a switch block, it does not need a break
- break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.
- If we skip break statement , all true cases will be printed.

syntax:
	switch (expression) {
		case value1:
			// Code to execute if expression equals value1
			break;
		case value2:
			// Code to execute if expression equals value2
			break;
		// Add more cases as needed
		default:
			// Code to execute if none of the above cases match
			break;
	}

example:

	int day = 4;
	switch (day) {
	  case 6:
		System.out.println("Today is Saturday");
		break;
	  case 7:
		System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
		break;
	  default:
		System.out.println("Looking forward to the Weekend");
	}
	
NESTED CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS.
--------------------------------
	- nested if 
	- nested if else 
	- nested else if 
	- nested switch 
	

				#################################################
							LOOPS IN JAVA 
				#################################################
				
- In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated 
	until a certain condition is reached.
- In Java we have 3 loops 
		- for loop 
			=> Used to iterate part of program several times. 
			=> If number of iterations is fixed. It's recommended to use for loop 
		- while loop 
			=> Used to iterate part of program several times. 
			=> If number of iterations is not fixed. It's recommended to use while loop 
		- do while loop
			=> Used to iterate part of program several times. 
			=> If number of iterations is not fixed. 
			=> If you must execute the loop atleast once. It's recommended to use do while loop 
			
		
for loop:
------------------

	for (initialization; condition; update) {
		// Code to execute
	}
	- initialization, condition, update are optional 
	- condition must be boolean either true or false
	
	Try this:
	
		for(int i=0, j=1; i<=10 && j<=10; i+=2, j+=2) {
            System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
        }
        
        for( ; ; ){  
            System.out.println("infinitive loop");  
        } 
        
Questions:
	- patterns 
	- find the largest num : O(n)
	- find the second largest num : O(n)
	- find the factorial : O(n)
		n = 3
		1 * 2 * 3 = 6
	- find the whether num is prime or not : O(n), find the optimized?
	- generate fibonacci series : O(n)
		0 1 1 2 3 5 8 
	- Linear Search (searching sorted and unsorted) : O(n)
	- Binary Search (searching in sorted data) : O(logN)
	
while loop:
-----------------    
        while (condition) {
            // Code to execute
        }
        
    example:
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
            i++;
        }

do-while Loop: 
--------------------------
    do {
        // Code to execute
    } while (condition);
    
    do{ 
          snoozeWakeupAlarm(); 
    } while(reallyNotThatLoud(voiceOfMom)); 

    example:
        int i = 0;
        do {
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
            i++;
        } while (i < 5);

For-Each Loop
---------------------
- The enhanced for loop is used to iterate over arrays and collections. 
- It simplifies iterating through elements without needing to use an index.
    for (type element : collection) {
        // Code to execute with element
    }   
    
    example:
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.println("number = " + number);
        }


Nested Loops:
-------------------
- nested loops are loops placed inside other loops. 
- This allows you to perform more complex iterations, such as iterating over multi-dimensional data structures like matrices 
- performing repeated tasks with multiple levels of iteration.
    - Matrix Operations
    - Generating Patterns 
    - Searching in Multi-Dimensional Data
    - Simulating Real-World Systems
    
    
    - nested for loop 
    - nested while loop 
    - nested do while loop 
    = nested for each 
- for ONE iteration of outer loop, INNER LOOP will execute all it's iterations 

example:
        String[] tasks = {"Task1", "Task2", "Task3", "Task4"};
        String[] servers = {"Server1", "Server2"};

        // Assign tasks to servers
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < servers.length; j++) {
                System.out.println(tasks[i] + " assigned to " + servers[j]);
            }
        }

            ####################################
                        LOOPING STATEMENTS 
            ####################################
            
1. break Statement
-----------------------
    - The break statement is used to exit from a loop (or a switch statement) prematurely. 
    - When break is encountered, the loop is terminated immediately.
    - Statements after break are not reachable.
   example:
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                break;
            }
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
        }
        System.out.println("Loop exited");
        
        
2. continue Statement
-------------------------
- The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. 
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
        }
        
3. return Statement
--------------------------
- The return statement is used to exit a method and optionally return a value.
  
examples:
   return; // for methods with no return value
   return value; // for methods with a return value

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printNumbers();
    }
    
    public static void printNumbers() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                return; // Exit the method when i is 5
            }
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
            }
        }

 

IMP POINTS:
--------------------
- Conditions in for ,while , do while loops should be always boolean either true or false
- for(;;) will raise infinite loop.
- Not Incrementing/Decrementing of index variables will raise while infinite loop.
- Choose FOR LOOP , when no of iterations are known in advance
- Choose WHILE LOOP , when we don't know no of iterations.
- {} curly brackets for block of scope is not mandatory when we have only one statement/instruction inside body of for/while/dowhile loops.
- In Nested LOOPS , for one each iteration of OUTER LOOP , the INNER LOOP has to complete all it's iterations.
- LOOPS will fall into following time complexities 
    - Big-Oh(n) 
    - Big-Oh(n^2) 
    - Big-Oh(n*logN) 
    - Big-Oh(n^3)
    
######################################################
                METHODS in JAVA 
######################################################
- A method is a way to perform some task.
- A method is a block of code or collection of statements grouped together to perform a certain task or operation
- It provides the easy modification and readability
- The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.
- TWO PHASES for methods i.e Declaration and Calling

Method Declaration:    
- The method declaration provides information about method 
        attributes, visibility, return-type, name, arguments.
- It has six components that are known as method header
    public int sum (int a, int b) {
        // body 
        return a+b ;
       }
- Method Signature: 
    Every method has a method signature. 
    It includes the method name and parameter list.

- Access Specifier: Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. 
                    It specifies the visibility of the method. 
    Java provides four types of access specifier:
        public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier.
        private: The method is accessible only inside same class.
        protected: The method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
        default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default
    Non-access Modifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized, transient, 
                            volatile, native.
 
Types of Methods:
--------------------
- Predefined Method
    predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries
    Also known as the standard library method or built-in method.
    ex: length(), equals(), compareTo(), sqrt(),power(),max(),min()
    
    // using the max() method of Math class  
    System.out.print("The maximum number is: " + Math.max(9,7));  

- User-defined Method:
    - It can Static Method or Instance Method or Abstract Method 
    
    public static void findEvenOdd(int num){  
        if(num%2==0)   
            System.out.println(num+" is even");   
        else   
            System.out.println(num+" is odd");  
    }
	
Static Methods:
	- declared with static keyword
	- bounded to class rather than object
	- we call directly with classname 
	
Instance Methods:
	- no need to declare static keyword
	- bounded to object/instance
	- we have to must call with object name only 
	

observations
---------------------
- we can call static methods from instance method 
- we cannot call instance methods from static methods

###########################################
                OOPS 
############################################
- OOP is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. 
- It focus on grouping of data and methods into classes, which represent real-world entities.
- OOP is designed to manage and organize code by 
    grouping related properties and methods into objects, 
    making it easier to model real-world entities and their interactions.
- Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language.
- Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.
- The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.

Advantages :
    - Modularity ( Encapsulation , Code Reusability) 
    - Maintainability (Code Organization)
    - Extensibility ( Inheritance, Polymorphism)
    - Abstraction

Different Programming paradigms:
---------------------------------------
1. Imperative Programming
    Focuses on describing how a program operates by specifying a sequence of commands or statements that change the program’s state.
    ex: C, C++, Java, Python (supports multiple paradigms, including imperative).
    
2. Procedural Programming
    A subtype of imperative programming that organizes code into procedures or functions.
    Focuses on code reuse through functions and procedures, organizing operations into reusable blocks.
   ex: C, Pascal, Fortran
   
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Organizes code around objects and classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
    ex:  Java, C++, Python, C#.
 
4. Functional Programming
     Emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens and focuses on immutability and statelessness.
     ex:  Haskell, Scala, Lisp, Erlang, and functional features in Python and JavaScript.
     
     
Prinicipals:
    Class: Class is specification or blueprint for the object
    Object: Object is a run-time entity.
    Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods into a class and restricts access.
    Inheritance: Allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.
    Polymorphism: Enables methods to do different things based on the object’s type.
    Abstraction: Hides complex details and exposes only the necessary parts.
        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

CLASS 
------------
- Class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions.
- Class is the only logical representation of the data
- Class is specification or blueprint for the object
- we use class keyword to declare classes in java
- A class in Java can contain:
    Fields
    Methods
    Constructors
    Blocks
    Nested class and interface

syntax:
    class <class_name> {  
        fields;  
        methods;  
        // others
    }  

- class names should be pascal case and singular

OBJECT
------------
- Object is a run-time entity.
- It is an instance of the class.
- An object can represent a person, place or any other item. 
- An object can operate on both data members and member functions.
- An object has three characteristics
        - State defined by variables
        - Behaviour defined by methods
        - Identity defined by unqiue code(hashcode)
    ex: Pen is an object. 
        Its name is Reynolds; color is white, known as its state. 
        It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.
        
- Creating a object to a class is called instantiation 
- It occupies the initial memory for the object and returns a reference.
- The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime.
- All objects get memory in Heap memory

Syntax:
    ClassName objectName = new ClassName();

    ex: Student student = new Student(); 
    

    public class Car {
        // Fields
        private String color;
        private String model;

        public Car() {}  // default no args constructor.
        
        // Constructor
        public Car(String color, String model) {
            this.color = color;
            this.model = model;
        }

        // Method
        public void displayInfo() {
            System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Color: " + color);
        }
    }

Terminologies
-----------------------
Variables == Fields == Data members == attributes
methods == member functions
object == instance 

3 Ways to initialize an instance/object attributes:
    1. By constructor
    2. By method (setters, getters) 
    3. By reference variable (only if access modifier is non private)

Try this:
    1.What are the different ways to create an object in Java?
		using new keyword
		using clone() method 
		using deserialization
		using newInstance
		
	2.Declare Student class with required Fields and Methods 
	3.Declare Bank class with following Fields
		branchName, accountNumber, currentBalance, typeOfAccount
		Methods:
			displayUserInfo(), getCurrentBalance(), deposit(double amt), withdraw(double amt)
			
Anonymous object:
    - Anonymous simply means nameless. 
    - An object which has no reference is known as an anonymous object. 
    - It can be used at the time of object creation only.
    ex: 
        new Pen().price;
    

Types of Classes:
------------------------
1.Concrete/Standard Class:
    - A standard class that can be instantiated and used to create objects. 
    - It provides full implementation of its methods.
    
    public class ConcreteClass {
        public void display() {
            System.out.println("This is a concrete class.");
        }
    }

2.Abstract Class: 
    - A class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is intended to be extended by other classes. 
    - It can have abstract methods (methods without implementation) as well as concrete methods (methods with implementation).
    - Act as base class with common functionality that subclasses can build upon.
    - An abstract class can contain zero or more abstract methods. 
	
    public abstract class AbstractClass {
        public abstract void abstractMethod(); // Must be implemented by subclasses

        public void concreteMethod() {
            System.out.println("Concrete method in abstract class.");
        }
    }

3.Interface:
    - A reference type in Java that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. 
    - Interfaces cannot contain instance fields or constructors.
    - Defines a contract that classes can implement
    - By Default 
	constant will be:  public static final 
	methods: public abstract
		
    public interface Drawable {
        void draw(); // Abstract method

        default void defaultMethod() {
            System.out.println("Default method in interface.");
        }
    }

4.Enum Class:
    - A special class that represents a group of constants 
				(unchangeable variables). 
    - Enums are used to define a collection of related constants.
    
    public enum Day {
        SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
    }
	- Can enum contains Instance variable, Constructor, methods? 
	

5.Inner Class:
    - A class defined within another class.
Member Inner Class: 
	Non-static inner class that has access to all members of the outer class.
	
	=> OuterClass.InnerClass oc = new OuterClass.new InnerClass() 
	
Static Nested Class: 
	Static inner class that does not have access to 
	instance variables of the outer class.
	
	=> OuterClass.InnerClass oc = OuterClass.new InnerClass() 
	
Method Local Inner Class: 
	Defined within a block of code, such as a method.

Anonymous Inner Class: 
	A class without a name, typically used 
	for implementing interfaces or extending classes in a concise manner

example:
public class OuterClass {
    private String outerField = "Outer";

    // Member Inner Class
    public class InnerClass {
        public void display() {
            System.out.println("Inner class accessing: " + outerField);
        }
    }

    // Static Nested Class
    public static class StaticNestedClass {
        public void display() {
            System.out.println("Static nested class.");
        }
    }

    public void method() {
        // Method Local Inner Class
        class LocalInnerClass {
            public void display() {
                System.out.println("Local inner class.");
            }
        }
        LocalInnerClass local = new LocalInnerClass();
        local.display();
      }
    }


    public class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Runnable runnable = new Runnable() { // Anonymous Inner Class
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    System.out.println("Anonymous inner class.");
                }
            };
			or 
			Runnable runnable2 = () -> System.out.println("Anonymous inner class.");
            runnable.run();
        }
    }


6. Singleton Class:
    - A design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance. 
    - It provides a global point of access to the instance.
    - Used to ensure that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application.
    
    public class Singleton {
        private static Singleton instance;

        private Singleton() {
            // private constructor to prevent instantiation
        }

        public static Singleton getInstance() {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }

Summary
----------------
    Concrete Class: Standard, instantiable class.
    Abstract Class: Cannot be instantiated, may contain abstract methods.
    Interface: Defines a contract that classes can implement, supports multiple inheritance.
    Enum Class: Represents a fixed set of constants.
    Inner Class: Defined within another class, includes member, static nested, local, and anonymous inner classes.
    Singleton Class: Ensures a single instance of a class throughout the application.
    Abstract Data Types/Data Structures: Classes representing data structures or abstract data types.
    
    
    
OOP's other prinicipals
-----------------------------
1. Coupling:
- Coupling refers to how dependent different classes or modules are on each other. 
- The goal is to have low coupling, which means classes are mostly independent and 
		changes in one class do not heavily impact others.
Example:
- Imagine you have a Car class and an Engine class. 
- If the Car class directly creates an instance of Engine, it means Car is tightly coupled with Engine.
- This means any change in Engine might force changes in Car.
- Instead of creating an Engine directly in the Car class
    you can pass an Engine object to Car via its constructor or a setter method. 
    This way, Car can work with any Engine implementation without knowing the details.
    
  class Engine {
        void start() {
            System.out.println("Engine started");
        }
    }

    class Car {
        private Engine engine;

        public Car(Engine engine) {
            this.engine = engine;
        }

        public void start() {
            engine.start();
            System.out.println("Car is running");
        }
    }


2. Cohesion:
- Cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single class. 
- High cohesion means a class has a well-defined purpose and all its methods and variables are related to that purpose.
- Ex: A Car class with methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate() is highly cohesive 
     because all these methods relate to the concept of a car’s operation.
    
    class Car {
        void start() {
            System.out.println("Car started");
        }

        void stop() {
            System.out.println("Car stopped");
        }

        void accelerate() {
            System.out.println("Car accelerating");
        }
    }
    
3.Association: 
- represents a relationship between two classes. 
- It indicates that one class uses or interacts with another class. 
- There are different types of association like one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
Ex:
    A Driver class and a Car class can be associated with a one-to-many relationship 
    if one driver can drive multiple cars.
    
    class Car {
        // Car properties and methods
    }

    class Driver {
        private List<Car> cars = new ArrayList<>();

        public void addCar(Car car) {
            cars.add(car);
        }
    }

4. Aggregation:
- It is a type of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship 
- But with weaker coupling compared to composition. 
- In aggregation, the part can exist independently of the whole.
- HAS-A relationship

Ex: Consider Library and Book relationship. A Library can contain many Book objects.
    But books can exist outside the library and be part of different libraries.

5. Composition:
- It is a type of association where the relationship is stronger than aggregation. 
- The part cannot exist independently of the whole. 
- If the whole is destroyed, the parts are also destroyed.
- PART-OF relationship

Ex: Consider a House and Room relationship. 
    A Room cannot exist without a House, and 
    if the House is destroyed, the Room should also be considered as destroyed.
   

In summary:
    Coupling: Degree of dependency between classes.
    Cohesion: How well the responsibilities of a class are related.
    Association: General relationship between classes.
    Aggregation: Whole-part relationship with weaker coupling (part can exist independently).
    Composition: Whole-part relationship with strong coupling (part cannot exist independently).

                CONSTRUCTORS in JAVA
###########################################################################
- It's special method same name as class name, used to construct something for program.
- A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
- It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
- Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
- By default JVM will invoke default constructor( which has empty body) 
		when class doesn't have any constructors declared.

NOTE: It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. 
    It's because java compiler creates a default constructor (constructor with no-arguments) 
	if your class doesn’t have any.
    
=> How Constructors are Different From Methods in Java?   
    
- Constructors must have the same name as the class within which it is defined  
    it is not necessary for the method in Java.
- Constructors do not return any type while 
    method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
- Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation 
    while method(s) can be called any number of times.


class Hello{
	// is it Valid?
	public void Hello() {
		System.out.println("hello constructor 1")
	}
	
	// is it Valid?
	public Hello() {
		System.out.println("hello constructor 2");
		return;
	}
	
	// is it Valid?
	public Hello() {
		System.out.println("hello constructor 3")
		return this;
	}
}
Example:
    
    import java.io.*;

    class Student {
        String name = "ram";
        int rollNumber = 172972625;
        
        Student() { // No args 
			super(); 
		} 
        
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            Student ram = new Student();
        }
    }
=> The first line of a constructor is a call to super() 
	or this(), (a call to a constructor of a super-class or an overloaded constructor),
=> Every class in java is the subclass of a class Object even if we don’t say extends object in our class definitio

RULES FOR WRITING CONSTRUCTORS
------------------------------------
1.The constructor(s) of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.

2.A constructor in Java can not be 
	abstract, final, static, or synchronized, volatile, transient, strictfp, native

3.Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access
    i.e which other class can call the constructor.
	
	
**NOTE**: we can use all access modifiers for constructor

TYPES OF CONSTRUCTORS IN JAVA
------------------------------------

### 1. Default Constructor:
- A constructor that has no parameters and no body is known as default the constructor.
- A default constructor is invisible.
- JVM will create the default constructor, if a class doesn't have any. 


### 2. No-argument constructor:
- A constructor that has no parameter is known as the No-argument or Zero argument constructor.
- If we don’t define a constructor in a class, then the compiler creates a constructor(with no arguments and empty body) for the class.
- And if we write a constructor with arguments or no arguments then the compiler does not create a default constructor.
ex:
    
    class Student {
        int rollno;
        String name;
        
        public Student(){
            System.out.println("No-Args Constructor called"); 
        }
    }
    public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Student s = new Student();
            System.out.println(s.rollno);
            System.out.println(s.name);
        }
    }

### 3. Parameterized Constructor:
- A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
- If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.

ex:
    
    class Student {
        int rollno;
        String name;
        public Student(int rollno, String name) {
            this.rollno = rollno;
            this.name = name;
        }
    }
    public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Student s = new Student(1,"kumar");
            Student s1 = new Student(2,"Ram");
        }
    }

CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING
-----------------------------
- Constructor overloading refers to the use of more than one constructor in an instance class.
- Each overloaded constructor must have different signatures

Ex:
    
    class Simple {

        Simple(String name) {
            System.out.println("Constructor with one "	+ "argument - String : " + name);
        }

        Simple(String name, int age) { // constructor with two arguments
            System.out.println(	"Constructor with two arguments : "
                + " String and Integer : " + name + " " + age);
        }

        Simple(long id) {
            System.out.println(	"Constructor with one argument : "
                + "Long : " + id);
        }
		
		Simple(int a, long b) {
			System.out.println("int, long constructor: " + (a+b));
		}
		
		Simple(long a, int b) {
			System.out.println("long, int constructor: " + (a+b));
		}
    }

    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Simple s1 = new Simple("Kumar"); // first 
            Simple s2 = new Simple("Avan", 26); // second
            Simple s3 = new Simple(325614567); // third
			
			Simple s4 = new Simple(10,20);
        }
    }
