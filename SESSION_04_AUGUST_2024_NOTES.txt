	INHERITANCE IN JAVA 
################################
- Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (the child or subclass) acquires the 
	properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class (the parent or superclass).
- Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

Why Inheritance?
- Code Reusability.
- Method Overriding ( runtime polymorphism) 
- Abstraction 

Terms used in Inheritance:
Class:
    A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
    It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

Sub Class/Child Class/ Derived Class:
    Subclass is a class which inherits the other class.
    It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.

Super Class/Parent Class/Base Class:
    Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features.
    It is also called a base class or a parent class.

Syntax:
-------------
class SubclassName extends SuperclassName{  
   //methods and fields  
}  

example:
	class Parent {
    // fields and methods
	}

	class Child extends Parent {
		// additional fields and methods
	}
	
Try this?
---------------------
    Can we extend more than one class at the same time? No
	Can we implement more than one interface at a time? YES
	Can an interface extends multiple interfaces at a time? YES
	


example-1
---------------	
	class Employee{  
	  float salary=40000;  
	}  
	
	class Programmer extends Employee{  
	   int bonus=10000;  
	   public static void main(String args[]){  
		  Programmer p=new Programmer();  
	      System.out.println("Programmer salary is:"+p.salary);  
	      System.out.println("Bonus of Programmer is:"+p.bonus);  
		}  
	} 

example-2
---------------

	class Animal {
	   
		protected String name;
		
		public Animal(String name) { // doesn't inherit
			this.name = name;
		}
		
		public void eat() {
			System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
		}

		public void sleep() {
			System.out.println(name + " is sleeping.");
		}

		public void makeSound() {
			System.out.println(name + " makes a sound.");
		}
	}


	class Dog extends Animal { // Subclass (Child class)


		public Dog(String name) {
			super(name); // Call the superclass constructor
		}
	   
		@Override
		public void makeSound() {  // Method overriding
			System.out.println(name + " barks.");
		}

		public void fetch() {  // Additional method specific to Dog
			System.out.println(name + " is fetching a ball.");
		}
	}


	class Cat extends Animal {

		public Cat(String name) {
			super(name); 
		}

		@Override
		public void makeSound() {
			System.out.println(name + " meows.");
		}

		public void scratch() {     // Additional method specific to Cat
			System.out.println(name + " is scratching.");
		}
	}


	public class Example {

		public static void main(String[] args) {
		   
			Dog myDog = new Dog("Rover");
			Cat myCat = new Cat("Whiskers");

			// Call methods on Dog instance
			myDog.eat();        // Inherited from Animal
			myDog.sleep();      // Inherited from Animal
			myDog.makeSound();  // Overridden in Dog
			myDog.fetch();      // Specific to Dog

			// Call methods on Cat instance
			myCat.eat();        // Inherited from Animal
			myCat.sleep();      // Inherited from Animal
			myCat.makeSound();  // Overridden in Cat
			myCat.scratch();    // Specific to Cat

			// Demonstrate polymorphism
			Animal myAnimal;

			myAnimal = new Dog("Buddy");
			myAnimal.makeSound();  // Calls Dog's makeSound() method

			myAnimal = new Cat("Luna");
			myAnimal.makeSound();  // Calls Cat's makeSound() method
		}
	}
- A parent class/ Interfac e/Abstract class reference variable can hold child class objects. 
- A child class reference variables cannot hold parent class objects 


##Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.

2. Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a superclass, and 
	then another class inherits from that subclass.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance: 
	Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.

4.Multiple Inheritance (through Interfaces): 
	Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes to avoid complexity and ambiguity. 
	However, a class can implement multiple interfaces.

5. Hybrid Inheritance: It's combination of one or more inheritances.
	
	
1. Single Inheritance
----------------------------
- In single inheritance, a class inherits from only one other class. 
- This is the most straightforward form of inheritance.
ex:
	class Vehicle {
		protected String brand;

		public Vehicle(String brand) {
			this.brand = brand;
		}

		public void start() {
			System.out.println(brand + " vehicle is starting.");
		}
	}	

	class Car extends Vehicle {
		private int doors;

		public Car(String brand, int doors) {
			super(brand);
			this.doors = doors;
		}

		public void honk() {
			System.out.println(brand + " car is honking.");
		}
	}

	
2. Multilevel Inheritance:
- A class inherits from another class, which in turn inherits from another class. 
- This creates a chain of inheritance.

	class Employee {
		protected String name;

		public Employee(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}

		public void work() {
			System.out.println(name + " is working.");
		}
	}

	class Manager extends Employee {
		public Manager(String name) {
			super(name);
		}

		public void manage() {
			System.out.println(name + " is managing the team.");
		}
	}

	class TeamLead extends Manager {
		public TeamLead(String name) {
			super(name);
		}

		public void leadTeam() {
			System.out.println(name + " is leading the team.");
		}
	}

3. Hierarchical Inheritance
--------------------------------------
- In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
ex:
	class Person {
		protected String name;

		public Person(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}

		public void introduce() {
			System.out.println("Hi, I am " + name + ".");
		}
	}

	class Student extends Person {
		public Student(String name) {
			super(name);
		}

		public void study() {
			System.out.println(name + " is studying.");
		}
	}

	class Teacher extends Person {
		public Teacher(String name) {
			super(name);
		}

		public void teach() {
			System.out.println(name + " is teaching.");
		}
	}

4. Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces):
- Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes but allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. 
- This is a form of multiple inheritance where a class can inherit from more than one source, but only through interfaces.
- Java doesn't support because of ambiguity problem [ Diamond problem]
example:
	interface Drivable {
		void drive();
	}

	interface Flyable {
		void fly();
		void drive();
	}

	class FlyingCar implements Drivable, Flyable {
		private String model;

		public FlyingCar(String model) {
			this.model = model;
		}

		@Override
		public void drive() {
			System.out.println(model + " is driving.");
		}

		@Override
		public void fly() {
			System.out.println(model + " is flying.");
		}
	}
	
Summary
------------------
Single Inheritance: 
	Extending one class (e.g., Car extends Vehicle).
Multilevel Inheritance: 
	Chain of inheritance (e.g., TeamLead extends Manager, which extends Employee).
Hierarchical Inheritance: 
	Multiple subclasses inherit from one superclass (e.g., Student and Teacher extend Person).
Multiple Inheritance (Interfaces): 
	A class implements multiple interfaces (e.g., FlyingCar implements Drivable and Flyable).

WHAT ALL ARE INHERITABLE FROM SUPERCLASS TO SUBCLASS 
=============================================================
1. Fields

Inherited: 
	Subclasses inherit all non-private fields from the superclass. 
	Protected and public fields are directly accessible in the subclass.
Not Inherited: 
	Private fields are not directly accessible in the subclass. 
	They are encapsulated within the superclass.

2. Instance Methods
Inherited: 
	Subclasses inherit all non-private instance methods from the superclass. 
	Protected and public instance methods are accessible and can be overridden in the subclass.
Not Inherited: 
	Private instance methods are not accessible directly in the subclass

3. Static Methods
Inherited: 
	Subclasses inherit static methods from the superclass. 
	However, static methods are not polymorphic. 
	This means that if a subclass defines a static method with the same name 
	as in the superclass, it hides the superclass's method (not overrides it).
	
4. Instance Blocks:
Not Inherited: 
 -Instance initialization blocks (instance blocks) are not inherited by subclasses. 
 -Each class has its own instance blocks that run when an instance of that class is created. 
 -However, if a superclass has an instance block, it executes before the subclass’s instance block when creating an object of the subclass.
 
5. Static Blocks:
    Not Inherited:  Static initialization blocks are not inherited. 
	- They are executed when the class is first loaded
	- And each class has its own static blocks which are executed in the order they appear. 
	- Static blocks from the superclass execute before those in the subclass 
			when the subclass is loaded.

6. Static Field:
	Inherited: Yes, but they are not polymorphic. 
		They are shared among all instances of the class.
	Hiding: A subclass can hide a superclass’s static field by declaring 
			a static field with the same name

7. Constructors:
	Inherited: No, constructors are not inherited.
	Calling Superclass Constructor: Subclasses can call a superclass constructor using super().

Summary
	Fields: Inherited except private fields.
	Instance Methods: Inherited except private methods.
	Static Methods: Inherited but hidden if redefined.
	Instance Blocks: Not inherited; each class has its own instance blocks.
	Static Blocks: Not inherited; executed when the class is loaded, 
			superclass blocks execute before subclass blocks.
			
		
- Method overriding vs Method Hiding.
	- Method overriding: If same instance methods is defined in parent, child with different body
	- Method Hiding: if same static method is defined in parent, child with different body.
	- Method overriding is resolved at runtime, based on runtime object 
	- Method Hiding is resolved at compile, based on reference variable
	


###########################################################
			this keyword in JAVA 
###########################################################
- The this keyword in Java is a special reference variable that refers to the current instance of the class.
- It is commonly used,
	=> Distinguishing Between Instance Variables and Parameters
	=> Invoking Other Constructors in the Same Class
	=> Passing the Current Object as a Parameter
	=> Returning the Current Object from a Method
- We can't use this in static context
- It is used to refer current class’s instance as well as static members.

Example:
	class Person {
		private String name;
		private int age;

		public Person() {
			this("Unknown", 0); // Calls the constructor with two parameters
		}

		public Person(String name, int age) {
			this.name = name; // 'this.name' distinguishes the instance variable from the parameter
			this.age = age;   // 'this.age' distinguishes the instance variable from the parameter
		}

		public Person setName(String name) {
			this.name = name; // 'this.name' refers to the instance variable
			return this;      // Returns the current instance for method chaining
		}

		public Person setAge(int age) {
			this.age = age;   
			return this;     
		}

		public void printDetails(Printer printer) {
			printer.printPerson(this); // Passes the current instance to the Printer class
		}

		@Override
		public String toString() {
			return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age;
		}
	}

		
	class Printer {
		public void printPerson(Person person) {
			System.out.println("Printing details from Printer:");
			System.out.println(person); // Uses the toString() method of Person class
		}
	}
	

###########################################################
			super keyword in JAVA 
###########################################################
- The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the 
		immediate superclass of the current object.
- It provides a way to access superclass members (fields, methods, and constructors) 
	that are hidden or overridden in the subclass.
- super is used to refer super-class’s instance as well as static members.

Uses of the super Keyword
    - Accessing Superclass Methods
    - Accessing Superclass Fields
    - Calling Superclass Constructor
    - Invoking Superclass Methods Overridden in Subclass

example:
	class Base {
		public void show() {
			System.out.println("Base class show()");
		}
	}

	class Derived extends Base {
		@Override
		public void show() {
			super.show(); // Calls the Base class method
			System.out.println("Derived class show()");
		}
	}

	public class Example {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Derived d = new Derived();
			d.show();
		}
	}

Summary:  
- Accessing Superclass Methods: To call overridden methods from the superclass.
- Accessing Superclass Fields: 
	To refer to fields in the superclass that are hidden by subclass fields.
- Calling Superclass Constructor: To invoke a constructor from the superclass.
- Invoking Superclass Methods: 
	To ensure that the superclass version of an overridden method is executed.
	
			##########################################################################################
												INTERFACE IN JAVA
			##########################################################################################
- An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class.
- It can contain only 
	constants
	method signatures / abstract methods
	default methods
	static methods and nested types
- An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. (provide contract of methods to be implemented)
- The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve [100% till java8]abstraction
- Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
- It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.
- Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.
- Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.

Why we use Java interface?
    - It is used to achieve abstraction.
    - By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
    - It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

Syntax:
	- An interface is declared by using the interface keyword.
	- It provides total abstraction; means 
		all the methods in an interface are declared with the empty body, 
		and all the fields are public, static and final by default.
	- A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface
	

interface <interface_name>{  
    // declare constant fields  
    // declare methods that abstract   
    // by default.  
}  


**NOTE**:
	The Java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method. 
	And it adds public, static and final keywords before data members/fields.
	
Example-1:
	interface Bank{  
		float rateOfInterest(); 
	}  

	class SBI implements Bank{  
		public float rateOfInterest(){
			return 9.15f;
		}  
		
	}  
		
	class PNB implements Bank{  
		public float rateOfInterest(){
			return 9.7f;
		}  

	}  

	class TestInterface2{  
		public static void main(String[] args){  
		 Bank b = new SBI();  
			System.out.println("ROI: "+b.rateOfInterest());  
		}
	} 
	
Example-2:
	interface PaymentMethod {
		void processPayment(double amount);
	}

	class CreditCard implements PaymentMethod {
		private String cardNumber;

		public CreditCard(String cardNumber) {
			this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
		}

		@Override
		public void processPayment(double amount) {
			System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of Rs" + amount 
									+ " with card number " + cardNumber);
		}
	}

	class PayPal implements PaymentMethod {
		private String email;

		public PayPal(String email) {
			this.email = email;
		}

		@Override
		public void processPayment(double amount) {
			System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of Rs" + amount 
					+ " with email " + email);
		}
	}

	public class Example {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			PaymentMethod creditCard = new CreditCard("1234-5678-9876-5432");
			PaymentMethod payPal = new PayPal("user@example.com");

			creditCard.processPayment(100.00);
			payPal.processPayment(50.00);
		}
	}
	
	
Java 8 Default Method in Interface
--------------------------------------
- Since Java 8, we can have method body in interface. But we need to make it default method
- Backward Compatibility:  
	To allow new methods to be added to interfaces without breaking existing implementations
	This is particularly useful for evolving libraries and frameworks.
	
example:
	interface Animal {
		default void eat() {
			System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
		}
	}

	class Dog implements Animal {
		// Dog class inherits the default implementation of eat()
	}

	public class Example {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Dog dog = new Dog();
			dog.eat(); 
		}
	}

Java 8 Static Method in Interface
---------------------------------------
- static methods in interfaces are used for utility or helper methods that are related to the interface 
- Static methods belong to the interface itself and can be called without creating an instance of the implementing class.

Example:
	interface MathOperations {
	
		static int add(int a, int b) {
			return a + b;
		}
	}

	public class Example {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			int result = MathOperations.add(5, 10); // Call static method using the interface name
			System.out.println("Sum: " + result); 
		}
	}

Java 9 Private Methods:
-------------------------------
- Private methods in interfaces allow for encapsulation of common code that should not be exposed to implementing classes. 
- They help avoid code duplication within default methods.
- Code Organization: Private methods enable better organization of code within an interface

Example:
	interface Vehicle {
		
		private void startEngine() { // Private method
			System.out.println("Engine started.");
		}
		
		default void drive() { // Default method
			startEngine(); // Calls the private method
			System.out.println("Vehicle is driving.");
		}
	}

	class Car implements Vehicle {
		
	}

	public class Example {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Car car = new Car(); or Vehicle car = new Car();
			car.drive();
		}
	}
=> interface reference varibles will hold objects of implementation classes

Summary:
-----------------
Default Methods: 
	Provide a default implementation for methods in interfaces, 
	facilitating backward compatibility and code reuse.
Static Methods: 
	Offer utility methods related to the interface that can be called without instantiating the interface.
Private Methods: 
	Allow encapsulation of common code within the interface, improving code organization and reducing duplication.
	
	
	
			##########################################################################
										ABSTRACTION IN JAVA
			############################################################################
- Abstraction in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming 
- It helps to manage complexity by hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features. 
- It allows you to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. 
- This is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

- Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
- The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods

- Two ways to achieve Abstraction
	
    a) Abstract class (0 to 100%)
    b) Interface (100%) till JAVA 7
	
ABSTRACT CLASS & METHODS 
------------------------------
- An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own 
- And can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (methods with a body).
- Subclasses must provide implementations for the abstract methods.
- It can have constructors and static methods also.
- It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
- Abstract methods can be non-private(no access modifier, protected, public)
 and non-abstract methods can be private.
- Implementation class overriden method must be higher visibility access modifier or same.


	abstract class Animal {
		public abstract void makeSound();
	
		void eat() {
			System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
		}
	}


	class Dog extends Animal {
		@Override
		void makeSound() {
			System.out.println("Woof!");
		}
	}


	class Cat extends Animal {
		@Override
		void makeSound() {
			System.out.println("Meow!");
		}
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Animal myDog = new Dog();
			myDog.makeSound(); 
			myDog.eat();       
			
			Animal myCat = new Cat();
			myCat.makeSound();  
			myCat.eat();        
		}
	}

NOTE:	
	- Can an abstract class can have Zero or more abstract methods? YES
	- When the constructor of the abstract class will executed/invoked? during child class object instantiation
	
INTERFACES
---------------------------------
- Interface is blueprint for class specification.
- Interface defines contract of methods to be implemented by sub classes. 
- Interfaces will contains till JAVA7
	public static final constants 
	public abstract methods 
- Interfaces cannot be instantiated and cannot have constructor 
- From JAVA future versions, it has 
	JAVA 8: default , static methods 
	JAVA 9: private methods 
	
- We can use access modifiers: public, default

Example:
	
	interface Animal {
	
		void makeSound();
		
		default void eat() {
			System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
		}
	}

	class Dog implements Animal {
		@Override
		public void makeSound() {
			System.out.println("Woof!");
		}
	}
	
	class Cat implements Animal {
		@Override
		public void makeSound() {
			System.out.println("Meow!");
		}
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Animal myDog = new Dog();
			myDog.makeSound();  
			myDog.eat();       
			
			Animal myCat = new Cat();
			myCat.makeSound();  
			myCat.eat();        
		}
	}

Try this?
-------------------
	Can we override abstract method of interface?
	Can we override default method of interface?
	Can we override static method of interface?



		############################################################
							POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA
		#############################################################
		
- Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
- Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs.
- The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.
- Two Types:
	1. Compile-Time/Static Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
	2. Runtime/Dynamic Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

METHOD OVERLOADING : 
===========================
- Compile-time polymorphism occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters 
	(different type, number, or both) within the same class.
- Method overloading increases the readability of the program.
- Multiple Ways to Overload the methods 
- Key Points for Method Overloading:
    Method Name: The method names must be the same.
    Parameter List: The parameter lists must differ (different number, type, or order of parameters).
    Return Type: The return type alone cannot be used to differentiate overloaded methods. 
				The compiler needs the parameter list to resolve method calls.


1. Different Number of Parameters:
- You can overload methods by changing the number of parameters.

Example:
	class Display {
   
		void show(int a) {  // Method with one parameter
			System.out.println("Value: " + a);
		}

		void show(int a, int b) { // Overloaded method with two parameters
			System.out.println("Values: " + a + " and " + b);
		}
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Display display = new Display();
			display.show(10);        // Calls show(int)
			display.show(10, 20);    // Calls show(int, int)
		}
	}



2. Different Types of Parameters:
- You can overload methods by changing the type of parameters.

Example:
	class Printer {
	
		void print(int a) { 	// Method with int parameter
			System.out.println("Integer: " + a);
		}

		void print(double a) { // Overloaded method with double parameter
			System.out.println("Double: " + a);
		}
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Printer printer = new Printer();
			printer.print(10);       // Calls print(int)
			printer.print(10.5);     // Calls print(double)
		}
	}

3. Different Order of Parameters
- You can overload methods by changing the order of parameters.

Example:
	class Calculator {
		void calculate(int a, double b) {
			System.out.println("Int and Double: " + a + ", " + b);
		}
		
		void calculate(double a, int b) {
			System.out.println("Double and Int: " + a + ", " + b);
		}
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
			calculator.calculate(10, 20.5);  // Calls calculate(int, double)
			calculator.calculate(20.5, 10);  // Calls calculate(double, int)
		}
	}
	
	
4. Incorrect Overloading:

Example:
	class Test {
		int getValue() {
			return 1;
		}

		double getValue() {
			return 1.0;
		}
	}
- both methods have the same name and parameter list, so this will result in a compile-time error.

TRY THIS?

	class ExampleTest{  
		public static void main(String[] args){
			System.out.println("main with String[]");
			
		}  
		public static void main(String args){
			System.out.println("main with String");
		}  
		public static void main(){
			System.out.println("main without args");
		}  
	}
	
Type Promotion In Method Overloading
--------------------------------------
- Type Promotion is a process where a smaller data type is automatically converted to a larger data type to match the method parameters
- Type promotion occurs in method overloading when you pass an argument that doesn't exactly match any of the method parameter types.
Example:
If a method parameter is double, and you pass an int value, 
		Java will promote the int to a double for method matching.
This automatic promotion happens according to the following hierarchy: 
byte → short → char → int → long → float → double.

Example 1: Promotion to a Larger Type
	class Calculator {
		void add(int a, int b) {
			System.out.println("int, int");
		}

		void add(double a, double b) {
			System.out.println("double, double");
		}
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Calculator calc = new Calculator();
			calc.add(5, 10);         // Calls add(int, int)
			calc.add(5.0, 10.0);     // Calls add(double, double)
			calc.add(5, 10.0);       // Calls add(double, double) due to promotion
		}
	}
	
Example 2: Promotion with Different Types
	class Test {
		void display(int a, double b) {
			System.out.println("int, double");
		}

		void display(double a, int b) {
			System.out.println("double, int");
		}
		
		void sum(int a,long b){ 
			System.out.println("int long arg method invoked");
		}  

		void sum(long a,int b) {
			System.out.println("long int arg method invoked");
		}   
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Test test = new Test();
			test.display(5, 10.5);   // Calls display(int, double)
			test.display(10.5, 5);   // Calls display(double, int)
			
			test.display(5, 10);    
			
			test.sum(20,20);
		}
	}

Method Selection Order:
- When Java selects an overloaded method, it uses the following rules:
Exact Match: If there is an exact match, it is chosen.
Type Promotion: If there is no exact match, Java will use the method with the 
		parameter types that best match through type promotion.
Varargs: If there is no exact match or suitable promotion, 
	Java will consider varargs (variable-length argument lists).

METHOD OVERRIDING
====================
- Runtime polymorphism occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
- The method in the subclass overrides the method in the superclass.

- Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
- Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

Rules:
    - The method must have the same name as in the parent class
    - The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
    - There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).
    - Overriden methods always must have greater or equal scope access modifier.(never assign weaker access modifier)

Example:
	class Bank {  
		double getRateOfInterest()	{
			return 5.6;
		}  
	}  
	 
	class SBI extends Bank {  
		double getRateOfInterest()	{ // overridden Bank getRateOfInterest() 
			return 8.5;
		}  
	}  
	  
	class ICICI extends Bank {  
		double getRateOfInterest()	{
			return 7.9;
		}  
	}  
	class AXIS extends Bank {  
		double getRateOfInterest() {
			return 9.2;
		}  
	}
	

TRY THIS?
    Can we override static method? yes, it is METHOD HIDING 
    Can we override java main method? // yes 

Covariant Return Type:
------------------------------
- The covariant return type specifies that the 
		return type may vary in the same direction as the subclas
- In Java, when you override a method, 
	the return type of the overriding method can be a subclass of the 
	return type declared in the superclass method.

- Before Java5, it was not possible to override any method by changing the return type.
- Applicable only to Non-Primitive [Reference Types, Classes, Interfaces, Arrays, Enums].
- When to Use Covariant Return Types ?
	Enhanced Flexibility: Provide more flexibility and specificity in method implementations.
    Method Chaining: Often used in fluent APIs to allow method chaining and more expressive code.
Example:
	class Animal {
		public Animal getAnimal() { // Method with return type of Animal
			return new Animal();
		}
	}

	class Dog extends Animal {
		@Override
		public Dog getAnimal() { // Overriding method with return type of Dog (a subclass of Animal)
			return new Dog();
		}
	}

	public class Example {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Dog myDog = new Dog();
			Animal animal = myDog.getAnimal(); // Returns a Dog object, but of type Animal
			System.out.println("Returned object: " 
			+ animal.getClass().getSimpleName());
		}
	}

METHOD HIDING
--------------------
- It occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same name and parameter list as a static method in its superclass.
- In Java, static methods are associated with the class, not instances of the class.
- It doesn't override the superclass method but hides it. 
- This means that the method call is resolved based on the reference type, not the actual object type.
- Method resolution happens at compile type based on reference type not on runtime object.

- Are these declarartion are valid?
	static void display() // in parent class
	void display() // in child class 
	
	void display() // in parent class
	static void display() // in child class 
	
Example:
	class SuperClass {
		static void staticMethod() {
			System.out.println("Static method in SuperClass");
		}
	}

	class SubClass extends SuperClass {
		static void staticMethod() {
			System.out.println("Static method in SubClass");
		}
	}

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			SuperClass.staticMethod();
			SubClass.staticMethod(); 

			SuperClass obj = new SubClass();
			obj.staticMethod();
		}
	}

Visibility and Access: 
- While you can indeed access the hidden static method using the class name (e.g., SuperClass.staticMethod() or SubClass.staticMethod()), 
	this does not change the fact that the method in the subclass is hiding the one in the superclass. 
- The term "hiding" describes the fact that if you use a reference of the superclass type, 
	you won’t see the subclass’s version of the method—it’s as though it’s been "hidden" from view


Key Points
--------------
- Static methods are not polymorphic
- Method hiding is resolved at compile time
- Static methods can be accessed using the class name

=> Difference between Method overriding and Method hiding:
- MH: both parent and child methods should be static 
- MOR: both parent and child methods should be non-static 

- MH: method resolution taken care by compiler based on reference  type
- MOR: method resolution taken care by JVM based on run time object 

- MH: it is compile or static polymorphism or early binding 
- MOR: it is runtime or dynamic polymorphism or late binding


STATIC BINDING AND DYNAMIC BINDING
===========================================
- Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding
There are two types of binding
    Static Binding (also known as Early Binding). 
				type of object is determined at compile time
    Dynamic Binding (also known as Late Binding). 
				type of object is determined at run-time


Static binding:
------------------
	- When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.
    - If there is any private, final or static method in a class, 
	there is static binding.

	class Dog {
	  private void eat() {
		System.out.println("dog is eating...");
	  }

	  public static void main(String args[]) {
		Dog d1 = new Dog();
		d1.eat();
	  }
	}
	
Dynamic binding:
--------------------
    When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding.
	class Animal {
	  void eat() {
		System.out.println("animal is eating...");
	  }
	}

	class Dog extends Animal {
	  void eat() {
		System.out.println("dog is eating...");
	  }
	  
	}
	
	class Cat extends Animal {
		void eat() {
		System.out.println("cat is eating...");
	  }
	}

	  public static void main(String args[]) {
		Animal a;
		a = new Dog();
		a.eat();
		
		a = new Cat();
		a.eat();
		
		a = null;
		a.eat(); // will throw NPE 
		
	  }
	}

INSTANCE INITIALIZER BLOCK
============================================
- Instance Initializer block is used to initialize the instance data memberS. 
It run each time when object of the class is created.
- There are three places in java where you can perform operations:
    method
    constructor
    block
	
Syntax:
		{
			// block of code 	
		}	
		
Example:
	class Bike{  
		int speed;  
		  
		Bike(){ 
			System.out.println("Bike Constructor invoked.");
			System.out.println("speed is "+speed);
		}  
	   
		{
			speed = 100; // instance block
		}  
		   
		public static void main(String args[]){  
			Bike b1=new Bike();  
			Bike b2=new Bike();  
		}      
	}


WHICH ONE IS INVOKED FIRST, INSTANCE INITIALIZER BLOCK OR CONSTRUCTOR?
Example:
	
	class Bike {  
		int speed;  
		  
		Bike() { 
			System.out.println("constructor is invoked");
		}  
	   
		static {
			System.out.println("static blocked invoked");
		}

		{
			System.out.println("instance initializer block invoked");
		}  
	}

RULES:
- The instance initializer block is created when instance of the class is created.
- The instance initializer block is invoked after the parent class constructor is invoked (i.e. after super() constructor call).
- The instance initializer block comes in the order in which they appear.

Example:
	class A {
		A() {
		  System.out.println("parent class constructor invoked");
		}
		{
		  System.out.println(" A class instance initializer block is invoked");
		}
	}
  
  class B extends A {
		B() {
		  System.out.println("child class constructor invoked");
		}
	  
		B(int a) {
		  System.out.println("child class constructor invoked " + a);
		}
	  
		{
		  System.out.println("B class instance initializer block is invoked");
		}
	  
		public static void main(String args[]) {
		  B b1 = new B();
		  B b2 = new B(10);
		}
  } 
  
  
FINAL KEYWORD IN JAVA
============================
- The final keyword in Java is a modifier that can be applied to variables, methods, and classes 
	to enforce specific constraints and behaviors

1) Java final variable: 
    If we make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).
	Ex:
		final double PI = 3.14;
		PI = 3.15; // Error 
		
	TRY THIS?
		 final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
		  sb.append(" World");
		  sb = new StringBuilder("New");
		   System.out.println(sb);
- final instance variables must be initialized at declarartion or 
	in constructor 
- final static variables must be initailized at declarartion or 
		in static block

2) Final Methods: 
- A method declared as final cannot be overridden by subclasses. 
- This is useful when you want to prevent changing the behavior of a method in a subclass.
Example:
	class Parent {
		public final void display() {
			System.out.println("Final method in Parent");
		}
	}

	class Child extends Parent {
	   
		public void display() { // // Attempting to override will result in a compile-time error
			System.out.println("Trying to override");
		}
	}

3) Final Classes:

- A class declared as final cannot be subclassed. 
- This is useful when you want to create a class that cannot be extended, ensuring its behavior remains consistent.
- Immutability
- Security

Example:
	final class FinalClass {
		// Class implementation
	}

	// Attempting to subclass will result in a compile-time error
	class SubClass extends FinalClass {
	}

	TRY THIS?
	----------------------
	class Test extends StringBuffer {
		// Implementation  
	}
	
	
4) Final Parameters:
You can also use final for method parameters to ensure that the parameter value cannot be modified within the method.

Example:
	public class Example {
		public void method(final int num) {
			num = 10; // Error: Cannot assign a value to final variable 'num'
			System.out.println(num);
		}

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Example example = new Example();
			example.method(5);
		}
	}
	
class A{
	final int num; // final instance variable
	A() {
		this.num = 0;
	}
}
