### INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING
◆ Machine/Binary/Low Level Lang - Writing Instructions in 0's ,1's
◆ Assembly Level Lang - Writing Instructions in Mnemonics
◆ High Level Lang - Writing Instructions in English like statements


----------------------------
## JAVA INTRODUCTION
	-   Java is General Purpose
	-   High Level
	-   Object oriented
	-   Functional and Robust Language writing instructions in English like statements.
- We can use java for developing 
	-   Mobile application - Kotin (Android studio)
	-   Web Application - (JSP & Servlets)
	-   Enterprise application (Spring Boot)
	-   Desktop application (applets, AWT)

--------------------------------------
## WHY JAVA  INVENTED?


-   For developing **platform Independent s/w** for digital electronic languages like
-   Set up boxes , Dishes, Tape recorders,  TV's , etc
-   C , C++ was not chosen because of platform dependency nature
-   Here Platform means OS and  hardware architecture
-   OS 
		- Windows , Linux , Macintosh
-   Hardware
	- 32 bit , 64bit, Intel , AMD


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## HISTORY OF JAVA
========================================================
◆ At First, java was developed only for portable devices
◆  With a team of 4 members started a project called **Green talk**   in 1991, under Sun Micro systems Company Management.
◆  Green talk project was lead by **James Gosling** ( considered as father of java)
◆ Later in 1994 name was changed to OAK (national tree of USA) due to trademark issues.
In 1995 Again changed name to JAVA ,and release first beta JDK version in 1996

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Java Terminology
--------------------------------------------------

***JDK : JAVA Development Kit***
-   It is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc
-   For a Program to execute/compile in local system we need to install JDK and class-path should be set after installation.
-   **JDK is platform dependent.**
-   Present Version of JDK: 21
```java	
	javac - compiler command
	java - runtime/running command
```

***JRE: JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT***

-   The Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, is a software layer that runs on top of a computer’s operating system software
-   Provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.
-   `JRE is a part of JDK`
-   **JRE is platform dependent**

***Java Virtual Machine(JVM):***

-   JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications.
-   JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code.
-   **JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).**
-   **JVM is also platform dependent.**

#### *Bytecode*

-   The Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM
- It is saved as .class file by the compiler.
-   To view the bytecode, a disassembler like **javap** can be used.
-   **`Byte Code can be defined as an intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code(JAVA Program). This intermediate code makes Java a platform-independent language`**.

#### *ClassPath:*

-   The classpath is the **file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files** to load.
-   By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.

-----------------------------------------------
## Primary/Main Features of Java.
1.  Platform independent
2.  Object oriented Language
3.  Simple & Secure & Robust
4.  Distributed
5.  Multi threading
6.  Portable , WORA (write once run anywhere)
7.  Compiled and interpreted

------------------------------

### STRUCTURE OF JAVA PROGRAM
1.  Comments/documentation
2.  Package statements
3.  Import statements
4.  Class declaration:
	- Static variable & methods
	-  Instance variables & methods
	- Local variables inside methods

🔴IMPORTANT❗🔴
 **Ever thing must be inside class declaration only in java.**


------------------------------------

### FIRST PROGRAM
--------------------------------------
```java
// Importing classes from packages
import java.io.*;

// Main class
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) // Main driver method
	{
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java World"); // Print statement
	}
}
```

***Comments***

- // Single line comment

- /* Multi line comments*/

***import java.io.*:***

-   This means all the classes of io package can be imported.
-   Java io package provides a set of input and output streams for reading and writing data to files or other input or output sources.

***class:***

-   The class contains the data and methods to be used in the program.
-   Methods define the behaviour of the class

***static void main():***

-   static keyword tells us that this method is accessible without instantiating the class.

***void:***

-   keywords tell that this method will not return anything.
-   The main() method is the entry point of our application.

***System.in:***

-   This is the standard input stream that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.
-   System is a class from java.lang package

***System.out:***

-   This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.

***println():***

-   This method in Java is also used to display text on the console.
-   It prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console.
-   The next printing takes place from the next line.

***String []args:***

-   This is the argument passed to the main function which is an array of strings with the array name args.
- Useful for command line arguments while running.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWO PHASES IN A JAVA PROGRAM
◆ Compilation phase
		**javac - compiler**
	```
	javac fileName.java
	```

◆ Execution phase.
**java - runtime tool**

```java
java bytecodeName or .className
```

---------------------------------------------------------
🔴IMPORTANT OBSERVATION❗🔴

🔥 **javac** (Java Compiler) will take care all java syntax checking and generates
BYTECODE

🔥 **JVM will load byte code into the memory** and start execution from the **main()**
method.

🔥 The Order of **public static** can be written in different ways

```java
public  static  void main(String[] args)
static  public  void  main(String[] args)
strictfp  final  public  static  void  main(String[] args)
```
🔥 String[] args can be written in different ways 

```java
	String[] args
	String []args
	String args[]
	String... args
``` 
- We can use any meaning variable name as part of **args**
➢ static keyword tells us that this **method is accessible without instantiating the
class.**
➢ System.in & System.out are **Standard Input & Output Streams.**
➢ System is a class belonging to **java.lang** and in & out objects belong to
**PrintStream** class.
➢ String []args : used for reading the command line args/values while running
the program.

🔥 **JDK(JVM+JRE) is platform dependent** because each OS will have different
instruction sets.

🔥 **ByteCode is PLATFORM INDEPENDENT** ,which makes Java as a platform
independent language.

🔥 **We can compile a class without a main method() & String[] args** , but we cannot run , it will raise a
Runtime Exception.

🔥 When a class is public **, java fileName must be the same as className.**- 
- When class is not public.
➢ **compile with fileName**
➢**run with className**
 🔴By default it will generate a bytecode with className having main() method


🔥 It is Possible to have **multiple classes in one file , it will create multiple .class files.**

🔥  Whenever we have multiple .class files while running , execute with individual names.
				
				java A
				java B

🔥 **Mark & Sweep is an algorithm** used by garbage collector to delete unused variables.

🔥 **HashCode** : Unique identification number allocated to objects by JVM.

🔥 JAVA is **case sensitive** and follows **UNICODE character representation.**

----------------------------
## VARIABLES
---------------------
- Variable is a **primary unit of storage container to store the values.**
- Variable is name to the memory location address in which value is store.
- Variables posses variability property, which means changes value during execution.

Syntax:
```
type variableName = value;
```
```java
int myNum = 5;
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
char myLetter = 'D';
boolean myBool = true;
String myText = "Hello";
```
**Rules**
1. Variable Can have Alpha+numeric characters such as 
	- LoweCase(a-z) 
	- UpperCase(A-Z) 
	- numbers(0-9) 
	- **Symbols ($, _)**
		```java
		String instution_Name = "SAIMEDHA ECET";
		String instution_Name2 = "SPACE GATE";
		```
2. Must not start with digit or number.
	```java
	int 9Number = 100; //Error
	```
3.  Java keywords cannot be used as variable names.
	```java
	long for = 10000L; //Error
	```

4. Blank spaces cannot be used in variable names.
	```java
	int student rank = 242; //Error
	```
5. Variable names are case-sensitive.
	```java
	int age= 10;
	int Age= 20;
	int AGE= 56;
	```

🔥NEW🔥
- There is no limit on the length of a variable name but by convention, it should be between 4 to 15 chars.




----------------------------
### Types Of Variables
--------------------------------------
***Local Variables***
- Declared inside method or block
- scope will be only within block/method, 
- **Initialization of the local variable is mandatory** before using it in the defined scope.
- We can access directly without object creation and class Name.
```java
import java.io.*;

class Variable {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int var = 10; // Declared a Local Variable
		System.out.println("Local Variable: " + var); // This variable is local to this main method only
	}
}
```

***Instance Variables***
- Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside of any method, constructor, or block.
- These variables are **created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.**
- We can use access specifiers for instance variables like (private,public,protected)
- ***Initialization of an instance variable is not mandatory , will have default values***
- Instance variables can be accessed only by **creating objects.**
```java
import java.io.*;
class A {
	public String name; // Declared Instance Variable
	public A() // Default Constructor
	{ 
		this.name = "Groot"; // initializing Instance Variable
	}
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		A a = new A();  // Object Creation
		System.out.println("my name is: " + a.name);
	}
}
```
***static Variables***
> Static variables are also known as class variables.
1. declared same as instance variables, the only difference is static keyword in declaration.
2. Unlike instance variables, ***we can only have one copy of a static variable per class, irrespective of how many objects we create.*** 
3. Static variables are **created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution** ends
4. `Initialization of a static variable is not mandatory, it will have default values.
5. We have to **use class name for accessing static variable** and methods.

	```java
	import java.io.*;
	class A {
		public static String count;		 //Declared static variable
		
		public static void main (String[] args) {
			System.out.println(" count is : "+A.count);
		}
	}
	```

---------------------------
## DATA TYPES
---------------------------------------

![enter image description here](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ec759a52ff5e884a628c05e3846c819c68ebafd073f512bbf5f9190245b42ae2/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f757661756d70452e706e67)
-  Defines the types of data to hold in variables.
-   Data types are divided into two groups:
    
    - Primitive data types(8) 
	    - includes `byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char` 
	- Non-primitive data types 
		- such as `String, Arrays and Classes`


🔴IMPORTANT❗🔴

🔥By default all **precious or fractional numbers** are double in JAVA

🔥By default all **numbers(whole numbers) are integers** in JAVA.

🔥 To Declare float values use f or F at end of value.

```java
 float salary = 10002.2323f;
```

🔥 To Declare Long type value use l or L at end of value.	
```java
long num = 10000000000L;
```

🔥 Each and Every data type will have its own size/range
	
	-2^(n-1) to +2^(n-1)-1 

🔥 For Declaring other number system formats we use following prefix,
		- Binary : 0B
		- Octal : 0
		- Hex-decimal: 0x

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n1 = 0B101;
        int n2 = 010;
        int n3 = 0x13;
    }
```

🔴 **byte data type follow chain process** after maximum positive reached, again it will start from max negative number.

```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte b = 126;
        b++;
        b++;
        System.out.println(b);
    }
``` 

🔥 byte or short data types while doing arithmetic with individual integer values always raises errors.
```java
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        byte b = 126;
        b = b+1;
        System.out.println(b);

        short s = 5;
        s = s*25;
        System.out.println(s);
    }
```  


🔥Guess the output🔥
```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        short s = 32766;
        s++;
        s++;
        System.out.println(s);
    }
```

---------------------------------
### Type Casting 
---------------------
- casting/converting one datatype to another datatype.
- Two Types of type casting we have in java

**Widening Casting (automatically)**
 - Done by JVM
- converting a smaller type to a larger type size
- byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
- No loss of data.
```java
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       char ch = 'A';
        int i = ch;
        byte b = 123;
        double d = b;
        
        System.out.println(i);
        System.out.println(d);
    }
```

**Narrowing Casting (manually)**
- Done by programmer/user.
- converting a larger type to a smaller size type
- double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte.
- Possibility for loss of data.
- syntax: **(type)**

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        float f = 10.232f;
        int i = 193732;
        // int i = f; //error
        int num = (int)f;
        byte b = (byte)i;
        System.out.println(num);
        System.out.println(b);
    }
```

**🔥GUESS THE OUTPUT🔥**

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        byte b;
        int i = 257;
        b = (byte)i;
        System.out.println("int to byte: "+ b);

        double d = 300.142;
        b = (byte)d;
        System.out.println("double to byte : "+b);

    }
```


**Type Promotion.**
1.  Java automatically promotes each byte, short, or char operand to int when evaluating an expression.
2.  If one operand is long, float or double the whole expression is promoted to long, float, or double respectively.

```java
     public static void main(String[] args) {        
           byte b = 42;
           char c = 'a';
           short s = 1024;
           int i = 50000;
           float f = 5.67f;
           double d = .1234;
    
           // The Expression
           double result = (f * b) + (i / c) - (d * s);

           System.out.println("result = " + result);
    }
```


**🔥GUESS THE OUTPUT🔥**

```java
	byte b = 50; 
	b = (byte)(b * 2);
```

----------------------------------------

## OPERATORS
--------------------------------------------------
- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
-  Types 
1. **Arithmetic operators**
```java
		int add = a+b;
        int difference = a-b;
        int multiplication = a*b;
        int quotient = a/b;
        int remainder = a%b;
        ++a; //post increment 
        a--; // pre increment
        
        b--; //post decrement
        --b; //post decrement
```

**2.Assignment operators**

```java
int price;
price = 10;
price = price+5;

price+=7; //compound assigment operator combines both + & =

price = price - 2;
price-=5;

System.out.println(price);
```

**3.Comparison operators**: Will always give boolean result true or false

```java
     int a = 10;
     int b = 6;
     System.out.println(a>b);
     System.out.println(a<b);
     System.out.println(a>=10);
     System.out.println(b<=6);
     System.out.println(a==b);
     System.out.println(b != b);
```

**4. Logical operators** : will always give boolean result 

![enter image description here](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fefb84f42bae71c8d113934b34d1f28d7d2fec0884c7d45e64c4bc1270766d68/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f784f7948786b332e706e67)
```java
     int rank=10;
     String college = "JNTU";
     
     System.out.println(rank == 10 && college == "jntu");
     System.out.println(rank == 11 || college=="JNTU");
     System.out.println(!(rank == 10 && college == "JNTU"));
```

**🔥GUESS THE OUTPUT🔥**

```java
int  a=10;
boolean  exp  =  a>5  ||  a++ >=10;
System.out.println(exp  +  " "+a);


boolean  exp2  =  a>20  ||  a++ >=10;
System.out.println(exp2  +  " "+a);
```

```java
int  num=5;
boolean  exp  =  num>10  &&  num++ >  5;
System.out.println(exp  +  " "+num);

boolean  exp2  = ++num>4  &&  num>=5;
System.out.println(exp2  +  " "+num);
```
 
**5. Bitwise operators** : 
- operates on bit/binary values.
- fastest among all operators.
**Bitwise OR (|)**
```java
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise OR Operation of 5 and 7
  0101
| 0111
 ________
  0111  = 7 (In decimal) 
```

**Bitwise AND (&)**

```java
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise AND Operation of 5 and 7
  0101
& 0111
 ________
  0101  = 5 (In decimal)
```

**Bitwise XOR (^)**
```java
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise XOR Operation of 5 and 7
  0101
^ 0111
 ________
  0010  = 2 (In decimal)
```
 **Bitwise Complement (~)**
```java
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)

Bitwise Complement Operation of 5

~ 0101
 ________
  1010  = 10 (In decimal) 
  
  Note: Compiler will give 2’s complement of that number, i.e., 2’s complement of 10 will be -6.
  
    // bitwise not
     int a = 5;
    // ~00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101=11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010
    // will give 2's complement (32 bit) of 5 = -6
    System.out.println("~a = " + ~a);
```


#### 6.Ternary Operator

![enter image description here](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9d97e0b02e3eec3876d88cfe183fc38c4adefe8f52672879ba90390e9024a6b3/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e6765656b73666f726765656b732e6f72672f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f32303139313132323137313035392f436f6e646974696f6e616c2d6f722d5465726e6172792d4f70657261746f722d5f5f2d696e2d4a6176612e6a7067)
```java
num1 = 10;
num2 = 20;

res=(num1>num2) ? (num1+num2):(num1-num2)
```

#### 7.Shift Operator in Java

 **Signed Left Shift**
 This operator is represented by a symbol <<, read as double less than. `
-  formula: n*2^bits` 
	 - 2*2^2 = 8
```java
        int number = 2;
        // 2 bit left shift operation
        int Ans = number << 2;
        System.out.println(Ans);
```

 **Signed Right Shift**
The >> sign represents the right shift operator, which is understood as double greater than `
- formula: n/2^bits`
```java
        int number = 8;
        // 2 bit signed right shift
        int Ans = number >> 2;
        System.out.println(Ans);
```
**Unsigned Right Shift** / **Zero fill shift operator**
The sign bit was filled with 0s. The Bitwise Zero Fill Right Shift Operator is represented by the symbol >>>.
```java
        byte num1 = 8;
        byte num2 = -8;
      
        System.out.println(num1 >>> 2);    //2
        System.out.println(num2 >>> 2);   //1073741822
```
-----------------------------------------------------------
### PRECEDENCE & ASSOCIATIVITY

----------------------------------------------------------------

![enter image description here](https://ecomputernotes.com/images/Operator-Precedence.jpg)
- The operator precedence represents how two expressions are bind together.
-  In an expression, it determines the grouping of operators with operands and decides how an expression will evaluate.


**QUESTIONS GUESS THE OUTPUT**

1.
```java
    	int a = 10, b = 5, c = 1, result;
    	result = a-++c-++b;
    	
    	System.out.println(result);
```

2.
```java
        int var1 = 5; 
        int var2 = 6;
        int var3;

        var3 = ++ var2 * var1 / var2 + var2;
        System.out.print(var3);
				
				
```

3. 
```java
			int x = 10, y = 20, z = 5;

## INPUT / OUTPUT IN JAVA
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Scanner class**
●allows the user to take input from the console
●Belongs to java.util package
●Used to read the input of primitive types like int, double, long,
short, float, and byte.
● 
	- nextInt()
	- nextFloat() 
	- nextDouble() 
	- nextByte()
	- nextLong() 
	- next() ,nextLine()

**Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);**

```java
    int num = in.nextInt();
     float salary = in.nextFloat();
     String name = in.nextLine();

     System.out.println(num+" "+salary + " "+ name);
```


### **Buffered Reader**
●Used to read a sequence of characters
●InputStreamReader() :
◆ converts the input stream of bytes into a stream of characters.
```java
BufferedReader bfn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```
●Integer.parseInt() , Float.parseFloat() , Double.parseDouble()
●**Integer, Float , Double are wrapper classes**

----------------------------------

### **OUTPUT** methods

**System.out.print(parameter);**
	◆ used to display a text on the console
	◆ prints the text on the console and the cursor remains at
	the end of the text at the console.

**System.out.println(parameter);**
◆ prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to
the start of the next line at the console
◆ The next printing takes place from the next line.

**System.out.printf(parameter);**
◆ Easiest of all methods as this is similar to printf in C.
◆ Uses format specifiers like %d %s %t %n %x %o

```java
	int rank = 10;
    short marks = 147;
    String name = "Ram";
    
    System.out.print(rank);
    System.out.print(marks);
    System.out.print(name);

    System.out.println();

    System.out.println(rank);
    System.out.println(marks);
    System.out.println(name);

    System.out.printf("%d %d %s",rank,marks,name);
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **STRINGS**

- Collection of characters(letters,symbols,other lang letters) surrounded by
double quotes
- String doesn't support indexing

```java
String s1 = "SaiMedha";
String s2 = "demo@123";
String phoneNumber = "998877665522";
String email = "saiMedha@ecet2023.com";
```
- Non-Primitive Type belongs to java.lang.String


**CREATION**

***1. Using literals***
```java
String s1 = "Hello Java, Learning Strings";
```
●Creates in string constant pool
●**Each time we create a string literal, the JVM checks the "string
constant pool" first.**
●If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled
instance is returned.
●If the string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is
created and placed in the pool.

***2.Using new operator***

**Created inside Heap Memory location.**
```java
String s = new String("Hello All, am NoBody :) ");
```
- Each time, it will create multiple string instance even though string already present in heap location.
- Every String instance Object will have different address.

**CONCATENATION.**
■ + operator can be used between strings to combine them
■ str + str —> str , str + int —> str
■ str + float —> str


**METHODS**
■length() , toUpperCase(), toLowerCase() , charAt() , isEmpty() ,
indexOf()
■trim() , equals() , hashCode() , replace() , startsWidth() , endsWidth()
■valueOf() , toString() , compareTo() , split() , matches()

---------------------------
### StringBuffer

➢ StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences.
➢ StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer("SaiMedha Students");
➢ **Is synchronized and Thread Safe.**
➢ Methods: 
	- append() , insert() , replace() ,reverse() , delete()
➢ **Created inside Heap Memory location.**
➢ Belongs to **java.lang.StringBuffer**

**CONSTRUCTORS**
```java
  public java.lang.StringBuffer();
  public java.lang.StringBuffer(int);
  public java.lang.StringBuffer(java.lang.String);
  public java.lang.StringBuffer(java.lang.CharSequence);
```
--------------------------------------------------
 ### StringBuilder
 ➢Represents a mutable sequence of character
➢ **non-synchronized and not a Thread Safe.**
➢ It’s more efficient than StringBuffer.
➢ StringBuilder builder=new StringBuilder("hello");
➢ Created inside Heap Memory location.
➢ Belongs to **java.lang.StringBuffer**

**CONSTRUCTORS**

```java
  public java.lang.StringBuilder();
  public java.lang.StringBuilder(int);
  public java.lang.StringBuilder(java.lang.String);
  public java.lang.StringBuilder(java.lang.CharSequence);
```



------------------------------------------------

## Arrays 
------------------------------

 - *Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable,
   instead of declaring separate variables for each value.*

◆ Arrays are stored in contagious memory [consecutive memory locations.
◆ implements the interfaces **Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.**
◆ direct superclass of an array type is Object.
◆ The size of an array must be specified b**y int or short value and not long.**
◆ An array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) and object (or
non-primitive)

**CREATION & INITIALIZING & ACCESSING**
array declaration has two components: **the type and the name**
```java
type var-name[];
type[] var-name;
```

➔ When an array is declared, only a reference of an array is created.
➔ To create or give memory to the array, you create an array like this:
◆ **var-name = new type [size];**
➔ 2 Ways to create an array.
	◆ Using new operator
	◆ Using literals ({data1,data2,data3..})
```java
       int num[];
       num = new int[10]; // using new 

       float decimals[] = {102.2f, 2.2f}; // literals
```
➔ Each element in the array is accessed via its index.
➔ The index begins with **0 and ends at (total array size)-1**
➔ Invalid index : ArrayIndexOutBound Exception.
➔ **When an array created with size , it will initialise with default values.**

--------------------------------------------
### **2D Array | Multidimensional**

data is stored in row and column based index (also known as matrix
form).

```java
dataType[][] arrayRefVar;
dataType [][]arrayRefVar; dataType arrayRefVar[][];
dataType []arrayRefVar[];
int[][] arr=new int[3][3]
```


### **Jagged Array :** creating odd number of columns in a 2D array
◆ It is an array of arrays with different no. of columns
